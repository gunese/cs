There are many ways of enabling new contributors to open source projects, but I'll list two things to do it efficiently in this write-up. Those two essential things are documenting everything and accepting all kinds of contributions.

First and foremost, a well-established documentation is needed for new contributors. This documentation should include the workflow that contributors should follow, project design, architecture, coding standards, FAQ and etc. A well-written documentation would save significant amount of time for both maintainers and contributors. Scikit-learn's "Contributing" document is a good example which covers how to contribute to the project in details.

Second, project maintainers should welcome all kinds of contributions. Some maintainers may accept only code contributions but there are other valuable ways to contribute in open source projects such as documentation of codes, unit tests,  typo fixes, submitting a bug report or feature request. Junior developers can start on open source projects by doing any of those contributions and eventually they can make code contributions as they become more experienced. Scikit-learn's "Contributing" document is also good example for this point which lists lots of different ways to contribute to the project.  Thus, it is very important to accept all kind of contributions which enables larger groups of new contributors.
