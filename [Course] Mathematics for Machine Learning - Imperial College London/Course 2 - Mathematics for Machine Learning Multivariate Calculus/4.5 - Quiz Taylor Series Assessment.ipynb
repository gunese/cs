    "Now that we have completed the set of Taylor series lectures and answered all the quiz questions, we now need to test our understanding of Taylor series. We have looked at the derivation of Taylor series, broken it down into a power series approximation, explored special cases and developed the idea of multi variant Taylor series, that is required in order for us to develop a good grounding for the next chapters in this course.\n",
