    "As mentioned in the previous video, the Taylor series approximation can also be viewed as a power series, in which these approximations are used to build functions that are often simpler and easier to evaluate, particularly when using numerical methods. In the following questions, we are looking at developing our understanding of how the increasing order of a power series allows us to develop further information of a function.\n",
