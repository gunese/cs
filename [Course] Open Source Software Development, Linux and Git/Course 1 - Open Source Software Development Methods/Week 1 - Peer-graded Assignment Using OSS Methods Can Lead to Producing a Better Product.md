I believe OSS methods can improve and accelerate a product's success in many ways, but I'll list two reasons to use OSS methods in this write-up. Those two reasons are faster development and easier to find investors.

First and foremost, you don't have to reinvent the wheel. OSS methods such as forking to an already made similar project can accelerate the development process a lot. As we already know, all of the Linux distributions are forks of a previous versions. None of their maintainers have written the entire Linux kernel from scratch and this allowed them to finish those Linux distributions in much shorter time. Not only the code but the huge know-how can be easily obtained with this method. Thus, software development process can be done faster with those methods.

The other most important reason is open source projects are perceived as more secure since their source codes are publicly shared. Being perceived as more secure can make the product easier to sell for marketing teams. Therefore, it can be easier to find investors for open source products and development can gain speed.
