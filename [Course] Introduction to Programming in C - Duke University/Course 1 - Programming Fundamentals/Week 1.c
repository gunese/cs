// Week 1 - Practice Quiz: Steps 1â€“4


// 1.
// You are following the Seven Steps and have just generalized your steps; 
// what do you do next?


// Test your algorithm


// 2.
// If you are doing Step 1, working an example by hand, and you find it difficult or are stuck,
// which two of the following could be problems?


// You lack domain knowledge.
// The problem is ill-specified.


// 3.
// If you are doing Step 3, generalizing, and you find it difficult to see a pattern, what is the
// recommended action?


// Repeat Steps 1 and 2 on different examples

// 1.
// The numbers in the table below are the result of executing an algorithm that has one 
// parameter N, a non-negative integer, and produces sequences of integers as outputs. For
// values of N from 0 to 5, the algorithm produces the following sequences of numbers as 
// outputs.

// N | output
// 0 | 0 2
// 1 | 3 5 7 9
// 2 | 6 8 10 12 14 16
// 3 | 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23
// 4 | 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30
// 5 | 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37

// Determine the algorithm that was used to generate the numbers in this table, and

// 1. Write it down.
// 2. Execute it for N = 6, and write down your result.
// 3. Give your description of the algorithm to a friend who is not a programmer, and ask him or her to execute it for N = 6.

// What is the sequence of numbers for N = 6? (Give your answer as integers separated by single 
// spaces.)

// 2.
// The diagrams shown below are the result of executing an algorithm with one parameter N, a
// non-negative integer, that colors boxes on a 10 by 10 grid. For values of N from 0 to 5, the
// algorithm produces the following patterns:

// Determine the algorithm that was used to draw these patterns and

// 1. Write it down.
// 2. Execute it for N = 6, and write down your result.
// 3. Give your description of the algorithm to a friend who is not a programmer, and ask him or her to
// execute it for N = 6.

// Which of the following diagrams is the result?


// The pattern with 7 red square-pairs and a single green square.
