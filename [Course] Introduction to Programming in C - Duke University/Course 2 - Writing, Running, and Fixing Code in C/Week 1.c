// 1.
// If you struggle with Step 3, which of the following is a good strategy? (Check all that apply.)


// Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with more examples.
// Make a table


// 2.
// What percent of your time spent creating code should be spent planning?


// %90


// 3.
// Why should you draw a picture/diagram as you solve a problem?


// Clear and precise pictures allow you to visualize the state of the problem as you manipulate it.


// 4.
// Which two of the following are the most important considerations described for Step 2?


// How you represent your problem with numbers.
// What exactly you did, in a step-by-step-fashion.


// 5.
// When you have almost-similar steps, it is important to find the pattern that lets you express
// them as repetition of the same step.

// Which of the following are reasons why this is important? (Check all that apply.)

// Repetition will let you express the code as a loop.
// Repetition will let you generalize over how many times those steps are executed.


// Week 1 - Practice Quiz: Step 5 Concepts


// 1.
// What is a good rule of thumb for when to abstract code out into a separate function?


// When you encounter a step in your algorithm that cannot be directly and easily 
//translated into one or two lines of code.


// 2.
// What is "top-down design"?


// Generating sub-problems to solve as you encounter complex steps in the higher-
// level problem.


// 3.
// When is switch-case preferable to if-else?


// When making a decision based on many possible numeric values.


// 4.
// What code construct is the most appropriate translation for algorithmic steps that call for 
// updating the values of variables?


// Assignment Statements.
