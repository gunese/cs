# 2.1  
 
# For the following C statement, what is the corresponding
# MIPS assembly code? Assume that the variables f, g, h , 
# and i are given and could be considered 32-bit integers 
# as declared in a C program. Use a minimal number of MIPS
# assembly instructions. 
 
# f = g + (h â€“ 5);
 

# Answer


# h -> $t0
# g -> $t1
# s -> $s1

addi	$t0, $t0, -5	# h = h - 5
add 	$s1, $t1, $t0	# f = g + h
