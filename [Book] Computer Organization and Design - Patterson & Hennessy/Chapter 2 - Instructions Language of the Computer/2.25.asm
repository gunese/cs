# The follow instruction is not included in the MIPS instruction set:
# rpt $t2, loop # if(R[rs]>0) R[rs]=R[rs]â€“1, PC=PC+4+BranchAddr

# 2.25.1

# If this instruction were to be implemented in the MIPS instruction set,
# what is the most appropriate instruction format?

# 2.25.2

# What is the shortest sequence of MIPS instructions that performs the
# same operation?


# Answer


# 2.25.1

# The most appropriate instruction format is I-type.

# 2.25.2

Loop:slt $t3, $0, $t2
 beq $t3, $0, DONE
 sub $t2, $t2, 1
