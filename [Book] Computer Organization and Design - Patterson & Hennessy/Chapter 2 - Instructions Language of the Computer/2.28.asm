# How many MIPS instructions does it take to implement the C code
# from exercise 27? If the variables a and b are initialized to 10 
# and 1 and all elements of D are initially 0, what is the total
# number of MIPS instructions that is executed to complete the loop?


# Answer

  
# There are 14 total instructions in the implementation.
# Instruction -> 3 + a * (4 + (3 + b * 8)) = 153
# 153 instructions will be executed with a = 10, b = 1.
