# Suppose the program counter (PC) is set to 0x2000 0000. Is it 
# possible to use the jump (j) MIPS assembly instruction to set 
# the PC to the address as 0x4000 0000? Is it possible to use the
# branch-on-equal (beq) MIPS assembly instruction to set the PC 
# to this same address?


# Answer


# Jump instruction can jump to 28 bits and
# Branch instruction can branch to 18 bits.
